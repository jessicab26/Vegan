            <h3>Hello, my name is Jessica Brogden</h3>
            <p>
              My Vegan Journey began in 2017 after watching several "telling"
              documentaries about the food industry (more on those later). Up
              until that point, I never dreamed of being a vegetarian or vegan.
              I live in the South, in Louisiana, born and raised. Like many
              other areas of the south, you typically have your choice of BBQ,
              soul food, fried chicken, or gumbo, just to name a few.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a Chick-Fil-A on every corner, Popeye's next to it, and
              enough BBQ restaurants to feed a small army, becoming a Vegan in
              the South was hard. And of course, when you live in Louisiana, you
              have to visit New Orleans yearly. The Crescent City is absolutely
              a foodies dream, and one of my favorite places to visit.
            </p>
            <p>
              But let's talk more about my journey. As stated above, I turned to
              veganism in 2017. It was a tough start for me being raised mainly
              on meat and potatoes, and not having any knowledge of Veganism.
              When I first started making the switch to more vegetarian/vegan
              options, it was definitely a slow but interesting transition. I
              was never a huge fan of vegetables growing up. In fact, potatoes
              and corn were about as far as I went. If it wasn't for
              <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, I don't know
              that I would have ever been successful in switching. I found 90%
              of my recipes on that website, and learned of others peoples'
              stories who were also beginning their Vegan Journey. Knowing that
              I was not alone certainly helped out because still to this day, my
              mom swears that I'm only "going through a phase". But I have
              honestly loved every second of it, and could never see myself
              turning back.

          <h3>First, let's talk a little bit about what Veganism is. . .</h3>
          <p>
            <em
              >"Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to
              exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of
              exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any
              other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use
              of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and
              the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of
              dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from
              animals."</em

          <div class="col-7">
            <p>
              Now that we have the definition down, let's talk about some key
              points:
            </p>
            <p><strong>Vegans can only eat salad?</strong></p>
            <p>
              Going vegan does not mean you are destined for a life of only
              <strong>Salads</strong>! This is a large misconception of the
              general public, and the cause of many hesitations when it comes to
              adopting a plant-based diet. Actually, vegans enjoy a wide variety
              of not only vegetables, but fruits, grains, nuts, seeds, beans,
              etc. All of these ingredients can be combined to create delicious
              and fulfilling recipes that will soothe your soul!
            </p>
            <p><strong>All Vegans are gay?</strong></p>
            <p>
              We've all heard it before, and if you haven't, well now you have.
              Meat = Masculinity; No Meat = Feminity. Wrong!
            </p>
            <p><strong>Vegan food is hard to come by?</strong></p>
            <p>
              Yes and no. If you live in a vegan friendly (larger) city like
              Portland, then there will be options almost everywhere for you.
              However, if you live in small town like myself, you'll find
              yourself searching high and low. Now, I know that every grocery
              store has a plethora of vegetables and fruits, nuts, seeds, etc,
              but there will come a time when you just do not feel like cooking!
              When that happens, vegan options in restaurants (sit down and fast
              food) are nearly impossible to find. But not totally impossible!
              We'll cover some out to eat vegan options later!
            </p>
            <p><strong>Lastly. . .</strong></p>
            <p>
              Always keep in mind that there are many different levels to
              Veganism. There are some that are completely plant-based, no
              animal by-products whatsoever, and will even avoid
              <strong>ANY</strong> animal exploitation event. Then, there are
              others that have made the step to give up meat but are still
              lingering on some animal by-products, and may even occasionally
              visit a zoo. Everyone is different! Just remember, you've already
              taken the biggest step of all by giving up meat! Your journey has
              already begun!
